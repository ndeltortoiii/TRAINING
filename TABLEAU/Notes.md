  1. descriptive analytics: hindsight ~ what happened, what’s happening
  2. diagnostic analytics: why things are happening ~ root cause analysis
  3. predictive analytics: trajectory ~ what is going to happen, likely scenarios
  4. prescriptive analytics: recommendations 
* 2 analytics team: trusted original and new scientific method using analytics

##### Using Structured Pyramid Analysis Plan (SPAPs) to Structure Your Thinking
* SMART goal on top
* independent variables middle
  * write as specific field calculation
* Specific analyses to run & graphs to make
* my mapping software: http://mindmapfree.com
* organize variables in a logical way
* layer two is categories of issues
* layer 2 is categories of behaviors
* layer 3 is marketing strategies of success
* layer 4 how to breakdown / aggregate
* layer 5 exactly what variable from what data source
  * color for know, may know, and no idea where source is
  * helps determine what critical data is missing
* prioritize each independent variable and reorder which path is available
* method of communication
