#Negotiation
### Introduction
* What is the pie, figure it out
  * Allocentric: Understanding the objectives of the other party
* how to make a bigger pie
* what the parties are trying to divide
*how to negotiate to get the largest price

###Module 1: What is the Pie?
* What’s at stake in the negotiation
  * Figuring out relevant issues
  * What each party brings to the table
  * What things are worth
  * Exploring ways they can each benefit from agreement and grow the pie

* What happens if the negotiation is successful and what happens if the negotiation fails and complete individually
* What A & B can get on their own vs. what they can get together
* *What is the gain available = what the pie is*
  * Equal power, split gain evenly plus what each gets on their own
* No matter what is at the table, it is most important to have a principle
* If you go low end to start, first get agreement on what the pie is, and only then propose the number. Or else you might find yourself ending up with less than half the pie when the other side insists your first offer isn’t your best.
* *Step 1: Calculate the Pie*

#### A Framework for negotiation
* Fairness = Equality
* could divide dollars or miles, shouldn’t though. 
  * fairness should be people = equal
* *Step 2: if 2 people you should get at least half of the pie*
* The principle of the divided cloth
  * Give each party what has been conceded by the other
  * Half of the disputed half
  * The largest claim he or she can justify
* 2 Stages to negotiation
  1. Making Claims
  2. Dividing Things Up
* In some negotiations the claims are really not negotiable
* *Not just proportional division method now, but also the principle of the divided cloth*
* Proportional division doesn’t account for what a party could get on its own
* once you put a claim on the entire pie, that’s it, cant claim more

#### The Shapley Value
* Three or more parties
* The Nucleolus
* Even though the order they get in is ACB, the taxi is not going to drop them off in that order
* Makes thing fair by averaging across all possible orders
* When 3 or more, may reach 2 person deal, 3 way split is no longer fair
  * The reason why one gets more of the pie is because he/she brings more to the mix than the other parties.
* It is the only solution that follows 4 properties
  1. There’s no money left on the table, nothing thrown away or wasted
  2. Who gets what does not depend on people’s names only size of pie
  3. If someone can never save anybody else money, they don’t get to share in the savings
  4. If there are two cost-sharing problems and we combine them, the solution to the combined problem is equal to the sum of the solutions to the separate problems.
